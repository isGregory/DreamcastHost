# Override file
# Author: Gregory Hoople
#
#
# This is a file that allows users to specify override commands and settings
# for the 'run.sh' script and the scripts it uses.
#
# Note: The order of these settings does not matter. Feel free to move
# settings around as you feel most convenient.



# Override Dreamcast Login
# Here you can specify the user account the Dreamcast needs to log into, and
# the password it needs to use. This can be useful if you want multiple
# Dreamcasts connected to the same computer, or use an account that's already
# set up.
#
# Default user is "dream"
# Default password is "dreamcast"
#
# Example:
# Login:	dream2		password2



# Override Modem Device Name
# Here you can place the name of the modem you want to use rather than have
# the program try to detect the modem.
#
# Example:
# Modem: ttyACM0
Modem:



# Override Dreamcast IP
# Here you can specify an IP address you want the Dreamcast to use.
# If no address specified the script will try to detect an address
# that is currently not in use.
#
# Example:
# Dreamcast IP: 192.168.1.53
Dreamcast IP:



# Override MS-DNS
# Here you can specify the DNS server address you want the Dreamcast to
# connect to.
#
# Priority for DNS settings are:
#	1) The "Set DNS" override trumps all if found.
#	2) As long as "DNSmasq off" is NOT used then
#		the local IP address will be used to
#		communicate with the dnsmasq program.
#	3) If "DNSmasq off" is used then the DNS used
#		by the local machine will be used.
#
# Note: Entries can be either an IP address or Domain
#
# Examples:
# Local Router
# Set DNS: 192.168.1.1
#
# Dreamcast-Talk (Example; address incorrect)
# Set DNS: dctalk.no-ip.info
#
# Sylverant PSO Server
# Set DNS: 67.222.144.120



# Override Webserver Installation
# Here you can place a setting to prevent the script from installing certain
# software that sets up the webserver.
#
# Apache	- Will not install the apache web server
# dnsmasq	- Will not install the "dnsmasq" program
#		which alters addresses used by the dreamcast
#		and directs them to the apache server
#
# Usage:
# Webserver Off



# Override Writing/Refreshing Settings Files
# When this program runs it will scan through settings and then update the
# settings file. This takes about a minute or two to do. If one feels settings
# aren't changing often, or perhaps edits have been made to those settings,
# the writing out of those files can be turned off.
#
# Usage:
# No Files



# Override Output Settings
# When the program runs with "Show All" it will also display the commands
# being sent and received from the modem in addition to the standard
# messages of this system. Regardless of this setting, all messages
# will be saved to the local log file.
#
# Usage:
# Show All


# Override Slowdown
# Certain modems are slow to respond upon receiving requests. With this
# setting, the script will take more time to wait after sending a message
# before it tries to communicate with the modem again.
#
# Usage:
# Slow


# Override Raspberry Pi
# There are a few quirks that are more specific to the Raspberry Pi.
# Putting this command will set the script to handle those issues.
#
# Usage:
# Raspberry Pi
Raspberry Pi 



################### NOTE: The following settings depend #####################
################### on apache and dnsmasq running       #####################


# Add Domains
# Here you can specify the Domains you want the apache server and dnsmasq to
# redirect to private HTML files.
#
# Example:
# Domain: www.sega.com
Domain: www.sega.com
Domain: sega.com
Domain: www.dreamcast.com
Domain: jetgrindradio.web.dreamcast.com
Domain: web.dreamcast.com
Domain: sonic2.dricas.ne.jp
Domain: dreamcast.planetweb.com
Domain: planetweb.com
Domain: test.com
Domain: www.test.com
Domain: shenmue.com
Domain: passport.shenmue.com



# Set Website Host
# Here you can specify the IP address for all websites if you want to direct
# to a different host than the local one.
#
# Example:
# Host: 192.168.1.13



# Set Groups
# Here you can specify the IP address or the domain you want a Group to
# redirect to.
#
# Example:
# Group:	GamePSO		192.168.1.13
Group:		GamePSO		192.168.1.29



# Set Server Redirect
# Here you can specify the Domains you want dnsmasq to redirect to and
# corresponding destination you want them to go to
#
# Destionations can be either an IP address Domain, or Group as
# specified below.
#
# IP Address -	The domain will be directed to the specified IP address.
# Example:
# Redirect:	www.sega.com	192.168.1.1
#
# Domain -	The domain will be directed to the specified domain by
# looking up the target domain's IP address.
# Example (redirect sega to google):
# Redirect:	www.sega.com	www.google.com
#
# Group -	The domain will be directed to the IP address of the Group
# that's specified. This is useful should a single game use many servers,
# using a group allows all these servers to point to a single location.
# Thus if the server changes, only a single location in this file needs to
# be updated.
# Example:
# Redirect:	pso.dream-key.com	GamePSO
#
# Note: Be aware issues may arise if "Redirect" and "Domain" have the
# same sites and differ only with sub domains. In that case the
# "Redirect" will take precedence
#
# Phantasy Star Online Uses:
# Redirect:	game01.st-pso.games.sega.net
# Redirect:	game04.st-pso.games.sega.net
# Redirect:	pso01.dricas.ne.jp
