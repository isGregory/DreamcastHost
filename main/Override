# This is a file that allows users to specify override
# commands and settings for the preference script.

#NOT IMPLEMENTED
# Override Writing/Refreshing Settings Files
# When this program runs it will scan through settings
# and then update the settings file. This takes about
# a minute or two to do. If one feels settings aren't
# changing often, or perhaps edits have been made to
# those settings, the writing out of those files
# can be turned off.
#
# Usage:
# No Files

# Override Output Settings
# This program will filter out certain things to
# keep the output cleaner. Here you can specify
# printing out stuff that is otherwise filtered
#
# Usage:
# Show All

# Override Webserver Installation
# Here you can place a setting to prevent the script
# from installing certain software that sets up the
# webserver.
#
# Apache	- Will not install the apache web server
# dnsmasq	- Will not install the "dnsmasq" program
#		which alters addresses used by the dreamcast
#		and directs them to the apache server
#
# Usage:
# Webserver Off

# Override Modem Device Name
# Here you can place the name of the modem you want to
# use rather than have the program detect the modem.
#
# Example:
# Modem: ttyACM0
Modem:

# Override Dreamcast IP
# Here you can specify an IP address you want the
# Dreamcast to use.
#
# Example:
# Dreamcast IP: 192.168.1.53
Dreamcast IP:

# Override MS-DNS
# Here you can specify the DNS server address
# you want the Dreamcast to connect to.
#
# The program will attempt to install software
# that uses itself as the DNS server and then
# connects out from there to the DNS server
# the DC-PC server is using.
#
# Note: You can list multiple overrides here and
# comment out ones you aren't using
#
# Example:
# Local Router
# Set DNS: 192.168.1.1
#
# Sylverant PSO Server
# Set DNS: 67.222.144.120
#Set DNS: 67.222.144.120

# Here you can specify the Domains you want
# the apache server and dnsmasq to redirect
# to private HTML files.
#
# Example:
# Domain: www.sega.com
Domain: www.sega.com
Domain: sega.com
Domain: www.dreamcast.com
Domain: jetgrindradio.web.dreamcast.com
Domain: web.dreamcast.com
Domain: sonic2.dricas.ne.jp
Domain: dreamcast.planetweb.com
Domain: planetweb.com
Domain: test.com
Domain: www.test.com
Domain: shenmue.com
Domain: passport.shenmue.com

# Here you can specify the IP address
# for all websites if you want to direct
# to a different host than the local one.
#
# Example:
# Host: 192.168.1.13

# NOT IMPLEMENTED
# Here you can specify the IP address
# or the domain you want a Group to
# redirect to.
#
# Example:
# Group:	GamePSO		192.168.1.13

# Here you can specify the Domains you want
# dnsmasq to redirect to and corresponding
# destination you want them to go to
#
# Destionations can be either an IP address
# Domain, or Group as specified below.
#
# IP Address -	The domain will be directed to
# the specified IP address.
# Example:
# Redirect:	www.sega.com	192.168.1.1
#
# NOT IMPLEMENTED
# Domain -	The domain will be directed to
# the specified domain by looking up the target
# domain's IP address.
# Example:
# Redirect:	www.sega.com	dc-talk.info.net
#
# NOT IMPLEMENTED
# Group -	The domain will be directed to
# the IP address of the Group that's specified.
# This is useful should a single game use many
# servers, using a group allows all these servers
# to point to a single location. Thus if the
# server changes only a single location in this
# file needs to change.
# Example:
# Redirect:	pso.dream-key.com	GamePSO
#
# Note: This will not be able to consistantly
# differentiate between a sub domain and base
# domain. So be cautious.
#
# Example:
# Redirect:	pso.dreamcast.com	192.158.bs.29

# Redirect:	game01.st-pso.games.sega.net
